# ExamSystem üéì
### A Java-based Exam System with Login Authentication

This project is a desktop-based, multiple-choice exam system built using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface. The application includes a straightforward **login authentication mechanism** and a user-friendly interface for taking an exam. It serves as a great example of core Java concepts, including GUI development, event handling, and basic user authentication logic.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* [cite_start]**User Authentication**: The system provides a login page with credential validation and limits login attempts to enhance security[cite: 17, 18, 19, 20].
* [cite_start]**Access Control**: After three consecutive failed login attempts, the application blocks access, requiring a restart[cite: 20, 21].
* [cite_start]**Multiple-Choice Exam**: The application presents a series of multiple-choice questions[cite: 15].
* **Score Display**: Upon completion of the exam, the final score is calculated and displayed in an informative popup.
* [cite_start]**Error Handling**: Clear popup messages are provided for invalid inputs and errors[cite: 18, 19, 20].

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project is organized into logical packages to maintain a clean codebase:

* [cite_start]`com.examsystem.auth`: Contains classes for user authentication, such as the `LoginPage`[cite: 14, 17].
* [cite_start]`com.examsystem.exam`: Manages the exam flow and questions[cite: 15].
* `com.examsystem.ui`: Houses generic UI components.
