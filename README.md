# ExamSystem üéì
### A Java-based Exam System with Login Authentication

[cite_start]This project is a simple, desktop-based multiple-choice exam system built using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface[cite: 1, 12, 162]. It provides a straightforward **login authentication mechanism** and a user-friendly interface for taking an exam. The application is designed to be a clear demonstration of core Java programming concepts, including GUI development, event handling, and basic user authentication logic.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* [cite_start]**User Authentication**: The system includes a robust login page with credential validation and a built-in security feature that limits login attempts[cite: 14, 17, 18, 19].
* [cite_start]**Access Control**: After three consecutive failed login attempts, the system locks the user out and requires a restart of the application[cite: 20, 21].
* [cite_start]**Multiple-Choice Exam**: The application presents a series of multiple-choice questions[cite: 15].
* **Score Display**: Upon completion of the exam, the final score is calculated and displayed to the user in an informative popup.
* [cite_start]**Error Handling**: The system provides clear pop-up messages for invalid login attempts and other errors[cite: 18, 19, 20, 21].

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project is organized into logical packages to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase:

* `com.examsystem.auth`: Contains classes related to user authentication, such as the `LoginPage`.
* [cite_start]`com.examsystem.exam`: Manages the exam flow and questions[cite: 15].
* `com.examsystem.ui`: Houses generic UI components and utility classes.
